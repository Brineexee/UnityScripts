# Unity Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of Unity scripts designed to simplify game development.

## Usage Guidelines
**Update 09/04/25:** I don't mind anyone using these scripts. I gave them a small cleanup and tried to make them better. You're free to use them.

## Script Descriptions

### Vector3FindTool
A handy tool for finding, copying, adding, and deleting Vector3 values in your scene.

### ChangeAllShaders
Select two shaders: the script searches through all scene materials for the first shader and replaces it with the second shader wherever it is used.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute improvements or new scripts. Contributions are welcome!
